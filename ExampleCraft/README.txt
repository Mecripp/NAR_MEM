NOTE
These craft would need to be copied to one of KSP's VAB/SPH locations to be read by the system.  
Either <KSP>/Ships/VAB/  or, <KSP>/saves/<name of saved game>/Ships/VAB/  (switch VAB for SPH if you want them there instead).  
As craft files are not read from the GameData folder, this is not installed as part of the mod when using any automated system (eg CKAN, github desktop etc).
NKR DEM is built in a mostly stock game.  The NAR MEM is built in a RO+RSS game.
